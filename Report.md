# THIS IS A TEST!!!!!!!
#Project Overview

##Objectives
                outline the project and define the problem
>* Improve the operation of their in-house call management center (CMC)
>* Assist Relationship Managers (RMs) in serving their end customers (and new potential customers)
>* Increase the efficiency of RM correspondences with customers, and increases the quality of the service provided (and the chances to achieve a sale)
>* Match RMs with customers according to RM skills and customer profiles, wherein an RMs skill profile is dynamically updated after being informed by data from each correspondence. 


##Functional Requirements
>* Matches customers based on RM performance and product knowledge 
>* Customers are segmented into social and cultural groups according to postcodes and surnames. 
>* RM profiles will be sorted based on their age, sex, cultural background, language proficiency, experiences and product knowledge. 
>* RM profiles and skill matrices are initialised upon hiring and generated based on data processed from a 10 minute questionnaire. 
>* RM profiles will be adjusted by the system based on their performance in selling packages and serving customers effectively and efficiently. 
>* an RM's skill score is calculated based on the RM's previous call durations and their profile
>* Outbound calls will be dialed by the system automatically according to a customer target list generated by the system. 
>* Each RM will have an outbound call target list generated for them based on their skills and profile. (the target list will be a list of tuples in the form of <potential customer, product proposed>).
>* The system must retrieve customer details from a database, display it to the RM, and provide the RM with guidelines and a script to provide their service. 
>* Customers are given a score of 1 - 10 indicating their likelihood to purchase the product. This score is calculated based on some preloaded criteria (eg. repeat customers have a higher score, customers from certain postcodes may have lower score averages, etc.)
>* The system will prioritise serving customers with higher scores with regards to inbound calls. 
>* A customer's call is directed to an RM based on the RM's skill level, and personal profile matches. 
>* Estimated call durations and outbound dialing schedules will be calculated based on an RM's skill level and previous performance.  
>* When the line is fairly busy, inbound customers will be redirected to an interactive voice response unit prompting them for options
>* The Interactive voice REsponse Unit will ask for call reasons in a few words, and then redirect the call to the automatic call distributor which will route the call to the first available appropriate RM. 

                Questions + Things That were Too Vague pertaining to the requirements in the case study 

                +What sort of data does the original database (where the customer's information was pulled from) have? (eg. does it mention the customer's age, sex, income bracket, etc. or do we only have access to post code and full name?)
                +How will surnames be sorted into cultures? What if it is a surname shared across cultures? (eg. lee)
                +How will an RM's product knowledge be calculated? Are we able to determine product knowledge from raw numbers? 
                +Will the calculated RM's skill score be calculated based on whether they achieved a sale in the call or not? Will inbound and outbound calls be weighted differently? 
                +Will a customer be put on two RM's target lists at the same time? 
                +If the system prioritises customers with higher scores in regards to inbound calls, then would it be possible for a customer to be waiting forever (because of their low score, and having being matched with a 'popular' RM) if people who called after them were prioritised over them?  How would this be reconciled. -- does this mean that customers with low scores will be given to RMs with high scores (a higher chance to 'convert' the customer) or RMs with low scores (to 'waste time' with together while leaving the good RMs free) 
                +How will a proposed product be determined for a target customer? * the specs currently only mentions matching customers and RMs, but not customers and packages.
                +How will the data from the 'call reason' be processed? will there need to be manual data entry to recategorise the customer's profile? 
                +How busy will the line have to be before the customer is directed to the interactive voice response unit?

#Project Approach

##Design and Planning Approach
                Describe your approach from a design thinking principles perspective
                Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum, you have used to carry out the procedure. In your explanation, ensure that you outline activities from Scrum that you use 



##Assumptions
                List assumptions you have made in the systems analysis.
>* a Profiler Tool to generate a customer profile already exists and will be utilised by the proposed system.
>* we are assumnig that a a database of all potential customers already exists to be profiled for outbound calls. 
>* We are assuming that the system will automatically readjust an RM's profile based on their performance following each call WITHOUT any human intervention (ie. the system takes raw data, and comes to a conclusion based on that- hence the profile will be adjusted accordingly. )
>* appended to the previous assumption -- the calculation will be a result of  whether a sale was made, the length of the call, and numeric rating values given by the customer following the call (if applicable- we are making an affordance for customers who do not bother rating). 
>* we are assuming that the guidelines and script provided to the RM will be dynamically generated based on the details in the customer's profile. (as opposed to a canned response chosen from a pile  )
>* we are assuming that this system is not responsible for rerouting inbound calls and only deals in data management (collection, display, parsing, etc.)
>* assuming that the estimated call duration will determine the size of an RM's outbound list

#System Proposal


##System models
                Document your proposed work-products and models

##Justifications
                Discuss the competitive advantages that might be gained in developing the new information system. Identify and disguss the possible adverse effects for this business if its new information system project fails.
