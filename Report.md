#Project Overview

##Objectives

A major travel company is looking to improve its  information system by upgrading the existing Call Management Center(CMC). 

                outline the project and define the problem
>* Improve the operation of their in-house call management center (CMC)
>* Assist Relationship Managers (RMs) in serving their end customers (and new potential customers)
>* Increase the efficiency of RM correspondences with customers, and increases the quality of the service provided (and the chances to achieve a sale)
>* Match RMs with customers according to RM skills and customer profiles, wherein an RMs skill profile is dynamically updated after being informed by data from each correspondence
##Functional Requirements
>* Matches customers based on RM performance and product knowledge 
>* Customers are segmented into social and cultural groups according to postcodes and surnames. 
>* RM profiles will be sorted based on their age, sex, cultural background, language proficiency, experiences and product knowledge. 
>* RM profiles and skill matrices are initialised upon hiring and generated based on data processed from a 10 minute questionnaire. 
>* RM profiles will be adjusted by the system based on their performance in selling packages and serving customers effectively and efficiently. 
>* an RM's skill score is calculated based on the RM's previous call durations and their profile
>* Outbound calls will be dialed by the system automatically according to a customer target list generated by the system. 
>* Each RM will have an outbound call target list generated for them based on their skills and profile. (the target list will be a list of tuples in the form of <potential customer, product proposed>).
>* The system must retrieve customer details from a database, display it to the RM, and provide the RM with guidelines and a script to provide their service. 
>* Customers are given a score of 1 - 10 indicating their likelihood to purchase the product. This score is calculated based on some preloaded criteria (eg. repeat customers have a higher score, customers from certain postcodes may have lower score averages, etc.)
>* The system will prioritise serving customers with higher scores with regards to inbound calls. 
>* A customer's call is directed to an RM based on the RM's skill level, and personal profile matches. 
>* Estimated call durations and outbound dialing schedules will be calculated based on an RM's skill level and previous performance.  
>* When the line is fairly busy, inbound customers will be redirected to an interactive voice response unit prompting them for options
>* The Interactive voice REsponse Unit will ask for call reasons in a few words, and then redirect the call to the automatic call distributor which will route the call to the first available appropriate RM. 

## Stakeholders

# Project Approach

## Design and Planning Approach

### Design Thinking Reflection 

    
We assumed that the current CMC is inefficient as it matches customers with relationship managers based on availability rather than skills and expertise. 
We also assumed that the previous system had no scoring system, hence, did not prioritise customers with higher likelihoods of purchasing above customers who would otherwise never purchase. This would have been exacerbated by the fact that during busy times, customers were put on hold which would have prompted them to hang up and refrain from using the service again due to the long call handling time. 

Furthermore, it is also assumed that in both the pre-existing and newly proposed system that a customer could be calling the travel company's customer support line for reasons apart from holiday package enquiry. This raises the need for a customer to be redirected to a relationship manager from a call routing branch operator; The workload of whom will be drastically reduced by the proposed interactive voice unit in the new system. 

The process of designing the new system utilised 'Point of View' statements which allowed for the close exmination of the perspectives of different users. These empathy statements allowed us to identify weaknesses in the existing system, and hence, facilitated for the creation of How Might We (HMW) statements, which formed the basis of the User Stories which formed the foundation for the newer, more efficient system. 

An example of this process is as follows : 
>* POV:  RM: “I wish I didn’t have to waste time calling customers who would’ve never bought a package anyway” 
>* HMW:  How might we… Let Relationship Managers speak to less customers who are less likely to buy a package, and more customers who are likely to buy a package. 
>* Resulting User Story : As a relationship manager I would like customers to be filtered by how likely they are to buy a package so I can waste less time on customers who won’t purchase a package, and spend more time selling packages to customers who will. 

This example identifies that in the existing system, relationship managers spoke to all possible incoming customers instead of customers whom had a higher likelihood of purchasing the product, which had resulted in longer, less productive call handling times, which would have greatly impacted the market share of the business. 

    




## Assumptions
            
These are assumptions about the previous system which justify the need for a new improved system 

### Inbound Calls
* All inbound calls were met with a human operator  who asks questions about their parameters ( address, age, sex, etc) and which package they’re interested in before being redirected to an RM operator who will pitch the sale. 
* During busy times customers were put on hold and were not directed to an interactive voice response unit. 
* Previous inbound calls were not directed to specific RMs and were given to soonest available RM.

### Outbound Calls
* Customer profiles were not taken into account when fielding calls to RMs - customers were not segmented by profile. 
* Previously generated target lists do not take into account customer parameters before being given to an RM.

### General (applies to both current and previous system ) 
* Old system only provided the original hiring questionnaire and did not adjust based on skills. 
* Skill profiles did not exist , so relationship managers could not be matched with their end customers based on 
knowledge. 
* Customers were not given points based on likelihood to purchase. 
* RMs were not given a score based on performance.
* In the new system : customers who have already been assigned an RM will be given to same RM again each time they call (in the old system they’re just given to any random RM that is available). 
* RMs 


## System design assumptions for the new system
* the CMC system automatically updates an RM's score after the call based on if a sale was made, and the total call time.
* there is a post-call IVR that asks the customer to rate their experience. 
* The CMC system updates the RM's score again if the customer rated the RM in the post-call IVR 
* After a call ends, the customer's score is updated based on a predetermined calculation of the call duration, whether the customer purchased a package and their original score. 
* In a customer's profile, the phone number is the one required attribute. Everything else can be blank and filled out manually by the relationship manager during a call OR if that information is public, assume there is a system that searches the internet based on the customer's phone number and takes data from matching social media profiles.

# Competitive advantages and possible effects if the project fails

With the Call Management Centre (CMC) system, operations for the travel company will be improved significantly due to dynamic flow control for inbound and outbound calls with a greater potential for relationship managers (RMs) to perform and advertise sales of holiday packages. The skill matcher feature for RMs and customers according to RMs skills and customer profile is a strategic tool to attain customer retention for existing customers to experience the best customer service to respond to their needs and become a trusted travel agent for all their future travels. This value of customer loyalty will further lead to word-of-mouth marketing for the travel company where the company can consider a discount in exchange for referrals. Also, the competitiveness of the travel agencies market is forcing its players to strategise and provide the best possible experience for the clients by inspiring trust as the foundation for every sale. The CMC system implements this value with the Profiler Tool and Skill feature to render the effect that the RMs have the clients’ best interest at heart to make convincing sales upon this trust. 
   

Hence, improved operations by specialisation through the CMC where customer service is improved by learning about the customer and assigning them to the right agent will build trust, foster goodwill and bring customer relations to the next level. 

Rating of the RM from a customer as another feature in the CMC system will be a valuable tool for the managers to evaluate the RMs and ensure that the best values, deals and customer services are provided to the clients. This data will also allow the managers to see the trends within the company which then can be compared to the industry or competitors to make further decisions and strategies to upgrade its operations. 

A score from 1-10 based on the likelihood to purchase the product is given to a customer according to some preloaded criteria at the automatic branch exchange will greatly optimise the company’s productivity. This score is dynamically updated following each customer interaction. A customer with a higher score will be prioritised and have their queue times expedited during busy periods. This will greatly reduce the time handling time spent on calls which do not yield sales. 

Implementation of the call routing and IVR (Interactive Voice Recorder) feature for inbound calls to further reduce operating costs for the company as it removes the need for a routing operator to reroute customers to appropriate RMs. It also provides a way for the customer to remain engaged in the system while being in the queue, hence reducing the likelihood of a customer hanging up before being served. The IVR will ask the customer about which specific package they may be inquiring about so that a more precise decision can be made on the RM to route them to. The aforementioned features of RMs scoring (profiling) and specialisation will allow managers to assess and spot inefficiencies with indications of their strengths and what needs to be improved where there may be opportunities to focus on RMs’ training and coaching. 

The automation of the manual tasks of RMs will minimise their busy time to a significant extent.  Therefore, this will improve agent productivity and customer satisfaction where per-call handling time is decreased where there will be more time allocated for outbound calls to reach potential customers and carry out more effective calls. 

In contrast, if the CMC system fails, there will be inefficiencies for the company where the RMs’ expertise cannot be utilised to its maximum potential leading to the increase with customer’s hold time and thus, diminishing customer satisfaction. If the CMC system fails due to long system response time and low speed and poor telephone connectivity, corresponding problems where functions of scoring and profiling compromised will have detrimental impacts on the travel company. Managers will not be able to see the RMs score and hence, cannot analyse performance and define potential factors that could be improved on resulting in inconsistencies with the customer experience. Clients who deemed the experience as negative will not proceed with their purchases with the company, nor will they refer other potential customers to the company.
