# Relationship Managers 

>***US01:** As a relationship manager I would like the customer’s profile or desired holiday package to be matched to my skill profile before the call gets sent to me so I can answer their questions better.
    Estimate : 
    Priority : 
    Acceptance Criteria : 


>***US02:** As a relationship manager I would like customers to be filtered by how likely they are to buy a package so I can waste less time on customers who won’t purchase a package, and spend more time selling packages to customers who will. 

>***US03:** As a relationship manager I would like a system that automatically dials the next customer on my target list so I can waste less time manually inputting a number and dialing it.

>***US04:** As a relationship manager I would like to be provided with a specialised script to match a customer’s profile so I can know exactly what to say for each customer  

>***US05:**As a relationship manager, I would like to speak to customers who belong to similar demographics(age, gender, cultural backgrounds)  to me so I can communicate and relate with them better. 

>***US06:** As a relationship manager, I would like to speak/target to the right customers with outbound calls so I can be more effective at convincing due to my expertise in the holiday package/destination. 

# Customers

>***US07:**As a relationship manager, I would like to speak/target to the right customers with outbound calls so I can be more effective at convincing due to my expertise in the holiday package/destination. 

>***US08:**As a cold called customer, I would like the subject matter of the call to be interesting to me so I can waste less time on a call that doesn’t concern me. 

>***US09:** As a customer, I would like to speak to Relationship Managers who have in-depth knowledge about the holiday package/s that I am interested in so that I am able to make an informed selection. 

>***US10:**As a customer, I would like to be routed to a Relationship Manager who is in a demographic more similar to mine so that I can comfortably explain my holiday preferences and plans to them. 


# Product Owner
>***US11:**As a product owner, I want the relationships manager’s profile change based on the results of their calls so that their profiles reflect their current knowledge and skills. 

>***US12:** As a product owner, I would like to know what aspects are affecting sales numbers so I can adjust the business strategy accordingly

>***US13:**As a product owner, I want  a score to tell me how productive a Relationship Manager is at their job so that I can provide them with longer or shorter call lists to make sure all targets are called in the shortest possible time.


# Call Routing Branch Operator 
>***US13:** As a call routing branch operator , I would like the customers to be greeted with an automated interactive voice system that lets them redirect themselves when lines are particularly busy so that I have a smaller workload.
