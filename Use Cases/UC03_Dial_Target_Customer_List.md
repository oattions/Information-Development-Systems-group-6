| **Supporting Information**      	| A customer target list should be unique to each relationship manager.  A customer target list’s length should be adjusted based on a relationship manager’s skill score. A recording of the call must be stored into the database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	|

| **Trigger**         | Customer does not consent to their data being collected, and the call being recorded.                                                 |
| **Step**            | RM ends the call.  The customer’s profile is removed from the database so that they are not called again.  Rejoin main flow at step 9 |
| **Post-conditions** | The call management database removes the non consenting customer’s phone number and profile from the database.                        |
