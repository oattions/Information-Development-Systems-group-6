>* US: As a relationship manager I would like the customer’s profile or desired holiday package to be matched to my skill profile before the call gets sent to me so I can answer their questions better. 

>* POV:  RM: “I wish I didn’t have to waste time calling customers who would’ve never bought a package anyway” 
>* HMW:  How might we… Let Relationship Managers speak to less customers who are less likely to buy a package, and more customers who are likely to buy a package. 
>* US: As a relationship manager I would like customers to be filtered by how likely they are to buy a package so I can waste less time on customers who won’t purchase a package, and spend more time selling packages to customers who will.
