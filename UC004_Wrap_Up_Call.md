| User Story                  	| US204: As a relationship manager, I want to prioritise serving customers who have a higher likelihood to purchase score  so that less time is spent serving customers who are less likely to yield sales. <br>US203: US302: As a product owner, I want to have the  RM’s skill score be  automatically updated following their calls so that their performance can be assessed and tracked to determine whether  further training is needed. <br>US303: As a product owner, I want the system to dial numbers automatically for the RM according to a customer target list so that RMs are able to more efficiently make more calls to outbound customers in a shorter amount of time.    |
