# Design Thinking Reflective Statement
We assumed that the current CMC is inefficient as it matches customers with relationship managers based on availability rather than skills and expertise. 
We also assumed that the previous system had no scoring system, hence, did not prioritise customers with higher likelihoods of purchasing above customers who would otherwise never purchase. This would have been exacerbated by the fact that during busy times, customers were put on hold which would have prompted them to hang up and refrain from using the service again due to the long call handling time. 


Furthermore, it is also assumed that in both the pre-existing and newly proposed system that a customer could be calling the travel company's customer support line for reasons apart from holiday package enquiry. This raises the need for a customer to be redirected to a relationship manager from a call routing branch operator; The workload of whom will be drastically reduced by the proposed interactive voice unit in the new system. 


The process of designing the new system utilised 'Point of View' statements which allowed for the close examination of the perspectives of different users. These empathy statements allowed us to identify weaknesses in the existing system, and hence, facilitated the creation of How Might We (HMW) statements, which formed the basis of the User Stories which formed the foundation for the newer, more efficient system. 


An example of this process is as follows : 
> **POV:**  RM: “I wish I didn’t have to waste time calling customers who would’ve never bought a package anyway” 

> **HMW:**  How might we… Let Relationship Managers speak to fewer customers who are less likely to buy a package and more customers who are likely to buy a package. 

> **Resulting User Story:** As a relationship manager I would like customers to be filtered by how likely they are to buy a package so I can waste less time on customers who won’t purchase a package, and spend more time selling packages to customers who will. 

This example identifies that in the existing system, relationship managers spoke to all possible incoming customers instead of customers who had a higher likelihood of purchasing the product, which had resulted in longer, less productive call handling times, which would have greatly impacted the market share of the business.
